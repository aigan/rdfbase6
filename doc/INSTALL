Installation instructions for a new clean install

 * Install paraframe

 * Check the dependencies for this package by doing
   + perl Makefile.PL
   + make test

 * You may want to install the documentation as man orh HTML. That's
   not handled by the makefile. You can also use perldoc on the actual
   files.

 * Create a PostgreSQL database with utf8 encoding:

Check that your database cluster is created with an lc_collate that
sorts your utf8 strings in an appropriate way. do a "show lc_collate;"
to find out the sorting. The cluster must be crated for the desired
sorting. You may use "pg_lscluster" to list your current clusters. You
have pg_dropcluster and pg_createcluster for creating a new cluster
with a diffrent configuration.

+ Become the postgres user and run psql

+ create the user for the ritbase database. See current users with
'\du'. You may use the same username as the user under which the
program is going to be run. "create user my_user".

+ create the database with your choosen name for your project. I'm
going to use the name rb1 in this guide. "create database rb1 with
owner=my_user encoding='unicode';"
