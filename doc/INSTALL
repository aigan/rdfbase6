Installation instructions for a new clean install

 * Install paraframe

 * Setup the database. See DATABASE below

 * If needed, replace system installed IMAP::BodyStructure with
   BodyStructure.pm found in this doc dir. (Or use the diff)
   Search path for module location is given by:
   perl -le"print for @INC"

 * Check the dependencies for this package by doing
   + perl Makefile.PL
   + make test

 * You may want to install the documentation as man or HTML. That's
   not handled by the makefile. You can also use perldoc on the actual
   files.

 * Configure demo/site.conf and initialize database content with
   demo/rb-demo-server setup_db




DATABASE
--------

These instructions are for a default Debian PostgreSQL installation
with a Debian default pg_hba.conf

$ sudo su postgres
$ psql
# create user "rb";
# alter user "rb" with password 'YOUR_SECRET_PASSWORD';
# create database "rb-test" with owner "rb";
# create database "YOUR_PROJECT_NAME" with owner "rb";
# \q
$ exit
# exit

This should give you a user rb with a database rb-test.

Details:

RB will only work with PostgreSQL. Use at least version 8.

Check that your database cluster is created with an lc_collate that
sorts your utf8 strings in an appropriate way. do a "show lc_collate;"
to find out the sorting. The cluster must be created for the desired
sorting. You may use "pg_lscluster" to list your current clusters. You
have pg_dropcluster and pg_createcluster for creating a new cluster
with a diffrent configuration.

 * Inside psql, use \l for listing the existing databases. Change the
   current connected database with \c. See \? for help.

 * See current users with '\du'. You may use the same username as the
   user under which the program is going to be run.

 * The database 'rb-test' is used for automated tests and it is also
   used for the demo server.  You should create your own database for
   your project.
